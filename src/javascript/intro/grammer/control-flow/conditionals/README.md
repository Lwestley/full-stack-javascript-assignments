# Conditionals

> Why do we need conditionals? What do we do day to day to use conditionals in our language? What are some examples of a conditional statement?

1. We will have to make many different decisions and actions based on contructors and conditionals. For example if a parameter is equal or not equal to something. 

2. Everyday we use conditionals. If I am hungry return food to my mouth, else don't eat anything. Something as simple as that is a conditional. Driving a car,following MPH, go over the MPH or go under, else get a speeding ticket. 

3. Examples of a conditional statement(look at answer #2). 


### Requirements

1. Create a function named ```greeting(age)``` that takes ```age``` as an input parameter.  Return a string that says ```'Hello!'``` if the age is above 18.  Return ```'Yo!'``` when the the age is less than 18.
2. Create a function named ```isTacoTuesday(day)```that takes ```day``` as an input parameter.  Return true if the day is equal to 'tuesday' and false if it's not.


### Observations

* What types of conditionals are there? if, else if
    * How is each type useful? With the different constructors we can apply this too many different functions with many different problems.
